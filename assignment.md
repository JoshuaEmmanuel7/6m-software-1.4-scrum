Implementing Scrum in the IT infrastructure setup for a school can significantly enhance the team's productivity by being in a more organized, flexible, and collaborative work environment.

Scrum is an agile framework that uses iterative progress, teamwork and continuous improvement.

Scrum breaks down the project into smaller tasks called sprints. It normally lasts at max 4 weeks. This allows the team to focus on specific objectives within a short time frame.

Scrum also promotes communication and collaboration among the team through daily meetings, which team members share what they have done? what challenges they have faced? and what they are gonna do next? 

Scrum encourages Continuous feedback and improvement through the sprint reviews which allows the team to evaluate how things are at the moment.

Scrum also involves the users like school admins or teachers in the planning and review processes making sure it aligns closely with the schools needs and priorities. This allows the team to be goal oriented and not do extra things that is not needed while also giving the users what they want, therefor ensuring user satisfaction.
